# SFUS Milestone 1 Foundation Bootstrap

This repository now includes the Milestone 1 foundation baseline for the monorepo, runtime contracts, and CI/CD scaffolding.

## Workspace Layout

- `apps/web` - frontend workspace baseline
- `apps/api` - backend workspace baseline
- `packages/config` - shared TypeScript, ESLint, and Prettier configuration

## Shared Toolchain Baseline

- TypeScript strict mode is centralized via `packages/config/tsconfig.base.json`.
- ESLint config is centralized in `packages/config/eslint.base.cjs` and consumed by root, `apps/web`, and `apps/api`.
- Prettier config is centralized in `packages/config/prettier.base.cjs` and consumed by root, `apps/web`, and `apps/api`.
- Root and app-level command surfaces run the actual toolchain (`tsc`, `eslint`, `vitest`, and `prettier`) rather than placeholder scripts.

## Root Commands

- `pnpm build` - recursively runs each app workspace build command.
- `pnpm lint` - recursively runs each app workspace ESLint command.
- `pnpm typecheck` - recursively runs each app workspace TypeScript no-emit check.
- `pnpm test` - recursively runs each app workspace `vitest` command.
- `pnpm format` - formats root workspace files plus `apps/*` and `packages/*`.
- `pnpm format:check` - checks formatting for the same workspace surfaces without writing changes.

## App Workspace Commands

- `apps/web` and `apps/api` each expose `build`, `lint`, `typecheck`, `test`, `format`, and `format:check`.
- Each app inherits shared TypeScript, ESLint, and Prettier settings from `packages/config` while executing its own local source-file commands.

## Frontend Shell Baseline

- `apps/web` is a Next.js App Router frontend shell for the Milestone 2 public landing experience, auth-entry routes, and authenticated-shell foundation.
- Styling stays within the Milestone 1 architecture baseline: CSS Modules for component/page styles plus shared global CSS custom-property tokens in `apps/web/app/globals.css`.
- Public-facing routes include the branded homepage (`/`), branded `404`, branded runtime error surface, returning-user sign-in (`/login`), and provider-first registration (`/register`) with local email/password fallback.
- The authenticated shell includes `/app`, `/profile`, `/settings`, and `/onboarding/username`; `/app`, `/profile`, and `/settings` all preserve destination intent for unauthenticated users with `/login?next=<route>`, and all authenticated routes redirect `user.onboardingRequired` sessions into username completion before normal authenticated use.
- Frontend health endpoints are available at `/health/live` and `/health/ready`.
- Frontend code targets the shared `/api` path contract. `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_PATH` defaults to `/api`, development rewrites forward to `WEB_API_ORIGIN` (`http://localhost:3001` by default), and non-development containerized routing can target `WEB_API_INTERNAL_URL`.

## API Identity And Authorization Foundation

- Milestone 2 Subtask 1 adds the first persistence-layer identity and authorization foundation to `apps/api` while keeping the current frontend shell public-only.
- Reviewed migration `1714435200000-identity-authorization-foundation.ts` introduces the `users`, `auth_identities`, `password_authenticators`, `auth_sessions`, `email_verifications`, `totp_secrets`, `totp_recovery_codes`, and `authorization_grants` tables with MySQL 5.7-compatible DDL.
- `UsersModule` owns user persistence through `UserEntity` and `UsersService`.
- `AuthModule` imports `UsersModule` and owns auth persistence through `AuthIdentityEntity`, `PasswordAuthenticatorEntity`, `AuthSessionEntity`, `EmailVerificationEntity`, `TotpSecretEntity`, `TotpRecoveryCodeEntity`, plus `AuthController` and `AuthService` for local auth and provider-backed (Google/GitHub) auth flows.
- `AuthorizationModule` owns reusable authorization grant persistence through `AuthorizationGrantEntity` and `AuthorizationService`.
- `AuthorizationService` now provides reusable global-role + ACL authorization decisions (`read`/`write`/`admin`) over generic resources (`resourceType`, `resourceId`, `ownerUserId`, `visibility`, optional `projectId`) so later content milestones can reuse one authz contract.
- `AppModule` now composes `DatabaseModule`, `UsersModule`, `AuthModule`, `AuthorizationModule`, `HealthModule`, `MediaModule`, `BlogModule`, `PagesModule`, and `NavigationModule` so the API can bootstrap the shared identity/authz and Milestone 3 content foundation as one application surface.
- Local password auth stores Argon2id password hashes after appending the required password pepper, and local login stays blocked until a primary-email verification token has been consumed successfully.
- Email verification tokens are generated at registration time, hashed before persistence with `AUTH_SESSION_TOKEN_PEPPER`, checked for expiry at verification time, and consumed once so the same token cannot activate the account twice.
- Session lifecycle is server-managed through the `sfus_session` HTTP-only cookie: login issues a new session, `GET /api/auth/session` resolves and refreshes the active session timestamp, idle or absolute expiry revokes the record, and logout revokes the current session and clears the cookie.
- MFA is implemented with TOTP plus recovery codes: authenticated users start enrollment at `POST /api/auth/mfa/enroll`, confirm at `POST /api/auth/mfa/enroll/verify`, and receive one-time recovery codes only after successful verification. Recovery codes are single-use during challenge or proof flows, and regeneration (`POST /api/auth/mfa/recovery/regenerate`) replaces the previous set after authenticated MFA proof. Disable (`POST /api/auth/mfa/disable`) also requires authenticated MFA proof.
- Password and external-provider login flows now return an MFA challenge whenever a verified TOTP secret exists. Challenge completion at `POST /api/auth/mfa/challenge` issues the session cookie, and challenge tokens are signed and single-use.
- External-provider auth is provider-agnostic via an adapter registry boundary, with deterministic account linking in this order: existing `(provider, subject)` identity match, then existing user by normalized email, then new pending-onboarding user creation.
- First-time external users are marked `onboarding_required` until `POST /api/auth/onboarding/username` sets a valid unique username; `GET /api/auth/session` now returns `user.onboardingRequired` so the web shell can gate authenticated routes.
- Auth API contract for frontend session-awareness:
  - `POST /api/auth/register`
  - `POST /api/auth/verify-email`
  - `POST /api/auth/login`
  - `POST /api/auth/mfa/challenge`
  - `POST /api/auth/mfa/enroll`
  - `POST /api/auth/mfa/enroll/verify`
  - `POST /api/auth/mfa/recovery/regenerate`
  - `POST /api/auth/mfa/disable`
  - `POST /api/auth/logout`
  - `GET /api/auth/session`
  - `GET /api/auth/external/:provider/start`
  - `GET /api/auth/external/:provider/callback`
  - `POST /api/auth/onboarding/username`
  - `GET /api/auth/profile`
  - `PATCH /api/auth/profile`
  - `GET /api/auth/settings`
  - `PATCH /api/auth/settings`
  - authenticated `login` responses return either `{ user, session }` or `{ mfa }` when a challenge is required; `session` remains stable `{ user, session }`
  - `PATCH /api/auth/profile` accepts profile-display-name updates only and returns `{ username, email, displayName }`
  - `PATCH /api/auth/settings` accepts username updates only, enforces uniqueness, and returns `{ username, email, emailVerified, mfaEnabled }`
  - `GET|PATCH /api/auth/profile` and `GET|PATCH /api/auth/settings` now run through the shared authorization layer for account-scoped access, including global-role and ACL grant checks when `?userId=<targetId>` is supplied for representative cross-account authorization coverage.

## Milestone 3 Content Foundation

Milestone 3 Subtask 1 adds the persistence and module foundation for blog posts, standalone pages, navigation items, comments, and shared media references.

### New Modules

- `MediaModule` owns `MediaReferenceEntity` for shared image-reference records used across content types.
- `BlogModule` owns `BlogPostEntity`, `BlogPostTagEntity`, and `BlogCommentEntity`, and exposes `BlogService` with an admin-only management authorization contract.
- `PagesModule` owns `StandalonePageEntity` and `PageRevisionEntity`, and exposes `PagesService` with an admin-only management authorization contract.
- `NavigationModule` owns `NavigationItemEntity`, and exposes `NavigationService` with an admin-only management authorization contract.

### Database Migration

Migration `1748736000000-milestone-three-content-foundation.ts` adds six tables to the MySQL 5.7.44-compatible schema:

- `blog_posts` — blog post records with `status` enum (`draft`/`published`/`unpublished`), `published_at` (nullable, may hold a future time), `summary`, `is_featured`, `comments_locked`, and `slug`.
- `blog_post_tags` — many-to-many tag associations for blog posts.
- `blog_comments` — comment records with `status` enum (`visible`/`hidden`/`removed`), `author_user_id` FK, nullable `parent_id` self-reference (one-level threading), and nullable `media_reference_id` FK.
- `standalone_pages` — managed site pages with `status` enum (`draft`/`published`/`unpublished`) and `slug`.
- `page_revisions` — page revision records with a `revision_number` unique constraint per page, plus `summary`, `change_note`, `editor_user_id`, and `featured_media_id`.
- `navigation_items` — navigation item records with a `parent_id` self-reference and `ON DELETE CASCADE`.

### Admin-Only Management Authorization

`BlogService.assertAdminManagementAccess()`, `PagesService.assertAdminManagementAccess()`, and `NavigationService.assertAdminManagementAccess()` each throw `ForbiddenException` for any caller whose role is below admin, delegating to `AuthorizationService.hasGlobalRole('admin')`. This contract must be called on all create, edit, publish, and delete operations for blog posts, standalone pages, and navigation items.

### Media Environment Contract

`ApplicationEnvironment` now includes a `media` field populated by `loadEnvironment()` at startup. The following variables are required:

- `MEDIA_UPLOAD_MAX_SIZE_BYTES` — maximum accepted upload size in bytes; must be an integer from 1024 to 20971520.
- `MEDIA_ALLOWED_MIME_TYPES` — comma-separated list of accepted MIME types; each entry must be a valid `type/subtype` string.
- `MEDIA_STORAGE_PATH` — local filesystem path for uploaded files; required non-empty string.

All three are validated by `loadEnvironment()` at startup; a missing or invalid value throws immediately before the application finishes bootstrapping.

### Shared Authoring Workflow (Milestone 3 Subtask 2)

Milestone 3 Subtask 2 adds the shared authoring infrastructure — a protected image-upload API, a server-side Markdown sanitizer, and three reusable web components — used across blog posts, standalone pages, and blog comments.

#### MediaModule Upload API

`MediaModule.register(environment)` is a dynamic NestJS module that exposes:

- `POST /api/media/upload?resourceType=<type>` — uploads an image for Milestone 3 content. Requires an active session (HTTP-only `sfus_session` cookie). Returns a `MediaUploadResult` with `id`, `storageKey`, `url`, `mimeType`, `sizeBytes`, `originalFilename`, and `createdAt`.
- `resourceType` must be one of `blog-post`, `standalone-page`, or `blog-comment`.
- The endpoint rejects requests from unauthenticated users with `401 Unauthorized`.
- `MediaService.uploadImage()` enforces the configured MIME allow-list and size limit, both read from the `media` environment block; any violation produces `400 Bad Request` with a human-readable message.
- Files are stored under `MEDIA_STORAGE_PATH` organized by `<resourceType>/<uuid><ext>`. The original filename is sanitized before persistence (directory traversal removed, non-word characters replaced with `_`, capped at 255 characters).
- `MediaModule` imports `AuthModule.register(environment)` to resolve sessions on the upload endpoint. The module exports `MediaService` and `TypeOrmModule` for reuse in later content modules.

#### MarkdownSanitizer (server-side)

`apps/api/src/media/markdown-sanitizer.ts` provides two functions used by all Milestone 3 content-write paths:

- `validateMarkdownBody(body: string): SanitizationResult` — inspects the raw Markdown body against a pattern list that blocks `<script>`, `<iframe>`, `<object>`, `<embed>`, `<form>`, `<input>`, `<button>`, inline event handlers (`on*=`), and dangerous URI schemes (`javascript:`, `vbscript:`, `data:`). Returns `{ safe: true }` or `{ safe: false, reason }`. Callers that persist body content **must** call this before writing and reject the request when `safe === false`.
- `normalizeMarkdownBody(body: string): string` — normalizes line endings to LF and trims surrounding whitespace without altering content. Call after `validateMarkdownBody`.

#### Web Components

Three shared components live in `apps/web/components/` and are reusable across all Milestone 3 authoring surfaces:

- `MarkdownEditor` (`markdown-editor.tsx`) — a fully controlled write/preview toggle. Props: `value`, `onChange`, `placeholder`, `rows`, `label`, `disabled`, `id`. Write mode shows a `<textarea>`; Preview mode renders via `MarkdownRenderer`. Owns no internal body state; callers decide when to persist.
- `MarkdownRenderer` (`markdown-renderer.tsx`) — renders stored Markdown as sanitized HTML in the browser. Strips all raw HTML tags from the Markdown source before conversion (defence-in-depth on top of the server sanitizer), converts a safe Markdown subset (headings, bold, italic, inline code, fenced code blocks, blockquotes, unordered lists, links, images), and rejects `javascript:`, `vbscript:`, and `data:` URI schemes in link and image attributes. Uses `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` with a purpose-built converter; no external Markdown library is required.
- `ImageUpload` (`image-upload.tsx`) — a shared image-upload widget. Props: `resourceType` (`"blog-post" | "standalone-page" | "blog-comment"`), `onUpload`, `onError`, `apiBasePath`, `disabled`, `label`. Posts `multipart/form-data` to `POST /api/media/upload?resourceType=<type>` with `credentials: "include"`. Handles `401` by surfacing an authentication-required message; delegates MIME and size enforcement to the server. Calls `onUpload(result)` on success so callers can insert the returned URL into the Markdown body.

#### Security Contract Summary

- Server-side MIME type and file-size validation in `MediaService` is authoritative. The `ImageUpload` component performs an early client-side `image/*` check only as a UX aid.
- All Markdown body content stored through Milestone 3 write paths must be validated through `validateMarkdownBody` before persistence; content that fails validation must be rejected with a `400` response.
- `MarkdownRenderer` applies a client-side HTML-strip pass before rendering so that any raw HTML that escaped the server sanitizer becomes a no-op in the browser.
- Upload authorization relies entirely on the `sfus_session` cookie resolved by `AuthService.resolveSession()`; the upload endpoint has no separate capability token.

### Blog Publishing Lifecycle (Milestone 3 Subtask 3)

Milestone 3 Subtask 3 adds the full blog publishing lifecycle: a `BlogController` with separated public and admin route surfaces, a complete `BlogService` with status-transition methods, and the corresponding admin and public web pages.

#### BlogModule API Routes

`BlogController` exposes two distinct access surfaces under `/api/blog`:

**Public routes — no authentication required, published content only:**

- `GET /api/blog` — returns all published posts as `{ posts: BlogPostSummary[] }` ordered by `publishedAt` descending. Draft and unpublished posts are never included.
- `GET /api/blog/:slug` — returns a single published post by slug as `{ post: BlogPostDetail }`. Returns `404` when the post does not exist or is not published, so draft and unpublished content is never exposed through this route.

**Admin management routes — require an active `sfus_session` cookie and the global `admin` role:**

- `GET /api/blog/admin/posts` — lists all posts regardless of status as `{ posts: BlogPostDetail[] }`.
- `GET /api/blog/admin/posts/:id` — fetches a single post by UUID.
- `POST /api/blog/admin/posts` — creates a new post in `draft` status. Body: `{ title, slug, body, featuredImageId?, tags? }`.
- `PATCH /api/blog/admin/posts/:id` — updates post fields. All fields are optional; only the supplied fields are changed.
- `POST /api/blog/admin/posts/:id/publish` — transitions a post to `published` status and records the current UTC timestamp in `publishedAt`.
- `POST /api/blog/admin/posts/:id/unpublish` — transitions a post to `unpublished` status.
- `DELETE /api/blog/admin/posts/:id` — permanently removes the post.

All admin routes return `401` when no session is present and `403` when the session's global role is not `admin`. Authorization is enforced by `BlogService.assertAdminManagementAccess(session.user.globalRole)` called at the top of every admin handler.

#### Authorization Model

`BlogService.assertAdminManagementAccess(actorGlobalRole: string)` is the single reusable authorization gate for all blog management operations. It delegates to `AuthorizationService.hasGlobalRole(actorGlobalRole, "admin")` and throws `ForbiddenException` for any role below admin. All admin `BlogController` handlers call this method before performing any data operation; no admin action is reachable without it. This pattern avoids inline role-checks scattered across handlers.

#### Post Status Lifecycle

```
draft → published (publish)
published → unpublished (unpublish)
unpublished → published (publish)
```

All transitions are permissive at the service layer: any status can be moved to any other status by calling the appropriate method. The public `GET /api/blog` and `GET /api/blog/:slug` routes filter exclusively on `status = "published"` regardless of how the record was last modified.

#### Response Shapes

`BlogPostSummary` (public list): `id`, `title`, `slug`, `status`, `summary`, `isFeatured`, `commentsLocked`, `publishedAt`, `featuredImageId`, `tags`, `createdAt`.

`BlogPostDetail` (admin or single-post views): all summary fields plus `body` and `authorUserId` and `updatedAt`.

#### Web Routes — Public Blog

- `/blog` — public blog index (`apps/web/app/blog/page.tsx`). No session required. Lists all published posts fetched from `GET /api/blog`. Each post links to `/blog/<slug>`.
- `/blog/:slug` — single blog post view (`apps/web/app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx`). No session required. Fetches `GET /api/blog/<slug>` and renders the post body via `MarkdownRenderer`. Displays a "Post not found" message when the API returns `null` (post missing or not published).

#### Web Routes — Admin Blog Management

All admin blog pages in `apps/web/app/admin/blog/` call `resolveProtectedSession()` followed by `hasGlobalRole(session.user, "admin")` on mount and redirect unauthenticated users to `/login?next=<current-route>`. A non-admin authenticated session shows an "Admin access required" error in place of the management UI.

- `/admin/blog` — admin blog list (`apps/web/app/admin/blog/page.tsx`). Shows all posts (all statuses) with inline Publish / Unpublish / Delete actions and a "New post" link to `/admin/blog/new`.
- `/admin/blog/new` — create a new draft post (`apps/web/app/admin/blog/new/page.tsx`). Form fields: Title, Slug, Tags (comma-separated), Body (via `MarkdownEditor`). On submit, calls `adminCreatePost()` and redirects to the edit page for the newly created post.
- `/admin/blog/:id/edit` — edit an existing post (`apps/web/app/admin/blog/[id]/edit/page.tsx`). Shows the current status and publish controls at the top, followed by the content editor form. Controls visible by status: unpublished/draft posts show "Publish now"; published posts show "Unpublish". Saving the content form calls `adminUpdatePost()`; lifecycle transitions call the corresponding `adminPublishPost` or `adminUnpublishPost` helpers from `blog-client.ts`.

#### blog-client.ts

`apps/web/app/blog/blog-client.ts` is the typed API client for all blog API calls. Public helpers (`listPublishedPosts`, `getPublishedPost`) fetch without credentials. Admin helpers (`adminListAllPosts`, `adminGetPost`, `adminCreatePost`, `adminUpdatePost`, `adminPublishPost`, `adminUnpublishPost`, `adminDeletePost`) send `credentials: "include"` so the session cookie is forwarded.

### Blog Comments (Milestone 3 Subtask 4)

Milestone 3 Subtask 4 adds blog comments: publicly readable, authenticated-member writable, and moderator/admin moderated.

#### Comment API Routes

**Public route — no authentication required, visible comments only:**

- `GET /api/blog/:postId/comments` — returns all comments with `status = "visible"` for a published post as `{ comments: BlogCommentDetail[] }`. Returns `404` when the post does not exist or is not published, preventing exposure of comments on non-public parent content.

**Member route — requires an active `sfus_session` cookie (any authenticated role):**

- `POST /api/blog/:postId/comments` — creates a comment on a published post. Body: `{ body: string, imageId?: string | null }`. The `body` field is run through `normalizeMarkdownBody` then `validateMarkdownBody` before persistence; a comment whose body fails sanitization is rejected with `400`. Returns `{ comment: BlogCommentDetail }` on success. Returns `401` when no session is present, `403` when the post is not published, and `404` when the post does not exist.

**Moderation routes — require an active `sfus_session` cookie and the `moderator` or `admin` global role:**

- `GET /api/blog/moderation/comments/:postId` — lists all comments for a post regardless of status as `{ comments: BlogCommentDetail[] }`. Returns `403` for non-moderator/admin callers.
- `PATCH /api/blog/moderation/comments/:commentId/status` — updates a comment's status. Body: `{ status: "visible" | "hidden" | "removed" }`. Records `moderatedByUserId` and `moderatedAt` on every status change. Returns `{ comment: BlogCommentDetail }`.
- `DELETE /api/blog/moderation/comments/:commentId` — permanently deletes a comment. Returns `{ deleted: true }`.

All moderation routes return `401` for missing sessions and `403` for sessions whose global role is below `moderator`.

#### Comment Authorization Model

`BlogService.assertModerationAccess(actorGlobalRole: string)` is the single authorization gate for all moderation operations. It throws `ForbiddenException` for any role that is neither `moderator` nor `admin`. All moderation `BlogController` handlers call this method before performing any data operation.

Comment creation does not require a minimum role beyond an active session, but the parent post must be in `published` status; attempting to comment on a draft or unpublished post returns `403`.

#### Comment Sanitization

All comment bodies pass through the shared Markdown sanitizer (`apps/api/src/media/markdown-sanitizer.ts`) before persistence:

1. `normalizeMarkdownBody(input)` — normalizes line endings to LF and trims whitespace.
2. `validateMarkdownBody(normalized)` — blocks `<script>`, `<iframe>`, `<object>`, `<embed>`, `<form>`, `<input>`, `<button>`, inline event handlers (`on*=`), and `javascript:` / `vbscript:` / `data:` URI schemes. Returns `{ safe: false, reason }` on violation.

A comment body that fails either step is rejected with `400 Bad Request` before the record is written.

#### Comment Response Shape

`BlogCommentDetail`: `id`, `postId`, `parentId` (nullable; set when the comment is a threaded reply), `authorUserId`, `body`, `status` (`"visible" | "hidden" | "removed"`), `mediaReferenceId` (nullable; references an attached image), `moderatedByUserId`, `moderatedAt`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`.

#### Web — Public Comment Display and Member Submission

`apps/web/app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx` now renders a comments section below each published blog post:

- The comments list is fetched from `GET /api/blog/:id/comments` immediately after the post loads. A comment-load failure is silently ignored so the post remains readable.
- Authenticated members see a comment form with a `MarkdownEditor` for the body and the shared `ImageUpload` component (`resourceType="blog-comment"`) to attach an optional image. The submitted image URL is inserted into the Markdown body before the form posts.
- Unauthenticated visitors see a "Sign in to leave a comment" link that preserves the current URL as the `next` parameter.
- Comment submission posts to `POST /api/blog/:id/comments` with the session cookie. The new comment is appended to the local list on success without reloading.

#### blog-client.ts — Comment Helpers

`blog-client.ts` now exports additional typed helpers:

- `listComments(postId)` — public, no credentials. Fetches `GET /api/blog/:postId/comments`.
- `createComment(postId, body, imageId?)` — member, sends `credentials: "include"`. Posts to `POST /api/blog/:postId/comments`.
- `moderationListComments(postId)` — moderator/admin, sends `credentials: "include"`. Fetches `GET /api/blog/moderation/comments/:postId`.
- `moderateCommentStatus(commentId, status)` — moderator/admin, sends `credentials: "include"`. Patches `PATCH /api/blog/moderation/comments/:commentId/status`.
- `deleteComment(commentId)` — moderator/admin, sends `credentials: "include"`. Deletes `DELETE /api/blog/moderation/comments/:commentId`.

### Standalone Pages (Milestone 3 Subtask 5)

Milestone 3 Subtask 5 adds versioned standalone page management with full admin CRUD, revision history, restore capability, and public routing for published pages.

#### PagesModule API Routes

`PagesController` exposes two distinct access surfaces under `/api/pages`:

**Public route — no authentication required, published content only:**

- `GET /api/pages/:slug` — returns a single published page as `{ page: PageDetail }`. Returns `404` when the page does not exist or is not published, so draft and unpublished content is never exposed through this route.

**Admin management routes — require an active `sfus_session` cookie and the global `admin` role:**

- `GET /api/pages/admin/pages` — lists all pages regardless of status as `{ pages: PageDetail[] }`.
- `GET /api/pages/admin/pages/:id` — fetches a single page by UUID.
- `POST /api/pages/admin/pages` — creates a new page in `draft` status. Body: `{ title, slug, body }`.
- `PATCH /api/pages/admin/pages/:id` — updates page fields and creates a new revision. All fields optional; only supplied fields change.
- `POST /api/pages/admin/pages/:id/publish` — transitions a page to `published` status and records the current UTC timestamp in `publishedAt`.
- `POST /api/pages/admin/pages/:id/unpublish` — transitions a page to `unpublished` status.
- `GET /api/pages/admin/pages/:id/revisions` — lists all revisions for a page ordered by revision number ascending as `{ revisions: RevisionDetail[] }`.
- `POST /api/pages/admin/pages/:id/restore/:revisionId` — restores a page to the content of a prior revision by creating a new revision that copies the source revision's title and body, then updating `currentRevisionId`.

All admin routes return `401` when no session is present and `403` when the session's global role is not `admin`. Authorization is enforced by `PagesService.assertAdminManagementAccess(session.user.globalRole)` called at the top of every admin handler.

#### Authorization Model

`PagesService.assertAdminManagementAccess(actorGlobalRole: string)` is the single authorization gate for all standalone page management operations. It delegates to `AuthorizationService.hasGlobalRole(actorGlobalRole, "admin")` and throws `ForbiddenException` for any role below admin. All admin `PagesController` handlers call this method before performing any data operation.

#### Revision History Contract

- Every `create` call records revision 1 with the initial title and body.
- Every `update` call appends a new revision; the revision number is monotonically incremented from the current highest revision on that page. `currentRevisionId` is updated to the new revision after each save.
- Every `restore` call appends a new revision copying the source revision's title and body, then updates `currentRevisionId` to the new revision. The original revision is preserved in the audit trail; `restoreRevision` does not overwrite existing records.
- Revision history is an admin-only surface; guests cannot access the revisions endpoint.

#### Page Status Lifecycle

```
draft → published (publish)
published → unpublished (unpublish)
unpublished → published (publish)
```

The public `GET /api/pages/:slug` route filters exclusively on `status = "published"` regardless of how the record was last modified. Draft and unpublished pages are never exposed through the public route.

#### Slug Validation

Slugs must match `^[a-z0-9]+(?:-[a-z0-9]+)*$` (lowercase alphanumeric words separated by hyphens). Invalid slugs are rejected with `400 Bad Request` on both create and update.

#### Response Shapes

`PageDetail` (all views): `id`, `title`, `slug`, `body`, `status`, `publishedAt`, `currentRevisionId`, `createdByUserId`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`.

`RevisionDetail` (revisions list): `id`, `pageId`, `authorUserId`, `editorUserId` (nullable; set when a different user edited the revision), `title`, `summary` (nullable), `body`, `changeNote` (nullable; free-text note describing the change), `featuredMediaId` (nullable), `revisionNumber`, `createdAt`.

#### Web Routes — Public Standalone Pages

- `/pages/:slug` — public standalone page view (`apps/web/app/pages/[slug]/page.tsx`). No session required. Fetches `GET /api/pages/:slug` and renders the page body via `MarkdownRenderer`. Displays a "not published" message when the API returns `null` (page missing or not published). Never exposes the edit UI.

#### Web Routes — Admin Standalone Page Management

All admin pages pages in `apps/web/app/admin/pages/` call `resolveProtectedSession()` followed by `hasGlobalRole(session.user, "admin")` on mount and redirect unauthenticated users to `/login?next=<current-route>`. A non-admin authenticated session shows an "Admin access required" error in place of the management UI.

- `/admin/pages` — admin pages list (`apps/web/app/admin/pages/page.tsx`). Shows all pages (all statuses) with inline Publish / Unpublish actions and a link to create a new page.
- `/admin/pages/new` — create a new draft page (`apps/web/app/admin/pages/new/page.tsx`). Form fields: Title, Slug, Body (via `MarkdownEditor`). On submit, calls `adminCreatePage()` and redirects to the edit page for the newly created page.
- `/admin/pages/:id/edit` — edit an existing page (`apps/web/app/admin/pages/[id]/edit/page.tsx`). Shows current status and publish/unpublish controls, the content editor form, and a Revision History panel listing all prior revisions with Preview and Restore actions. Saving calls `adminUpdatePage()`; lifecycle transitions call `adminPublishPage` or `adminUnpublishPage`; restore calls `adminRestoreRevision`.

#### pages-client.ts

`apps/web/app/pages/pages-client.ts` is the typed API client for all standalone pages calls. The public helper (`getPublishedPage`) fetches without credentials. Admin helpers (`adminListAllPages`, `adminGetPage`, `adminCreatePage`, `adminUpdatePage`, `adminPublishPage`, `adminUnpublishPage`, `adminListRevisions`, `adminRestoreRevision`) send `credentials: "include"` so the session cookie is forwarded.

#### Scope Boundaries

Standalone pages in Milestone 3 are managed site pages (About, Rules, Contact, and similar). They do not introduce a block-builder UI, wiki hierarchy, document namespaces, or collaborative wiki workflows. Those features are deferred to Milestone 5.

### Admin Navigation (Milestone 3 Subtask 6)

Milestone 3 Subtask 6 adds a configurable admin navigation system. Site navigation items are managed through an API-backed CRUD interface and rendered dynamically in the public shell, replacing the previous hardcoded nav links.

#### NavigationModule API Routes

`NavigationController` exposes two distinct access surfaces under `/api/navigation`:

**Public read routes — no authentication required for the public surface:**

- `GET /api/navigation/items/public` — returns all active navigation items with `visibility = "public"`, ordered by `sortOrder` ascending. Returns `{ items: NavigationItemDetail[] }` where each top-level item includes its active children in a `children` array. Safe for guest access.
- `GET /api/navigation/items/authenticated` — returns all active navigation items (both `public` and `authenticated` visibility), ordered by `sortOrder` ascending, with one level of active children. For use when a session is present.

**Admin management routes — require an active `sfus_session` cookie and the global `admin` role:**

- `GET /api/navigation/admin` — lists all navigation items regardless of visibility or active status as `{ items: NavigationItemDetail[] }`. Top-level items ordered by `sortOrder`; each includes its children.
- `POST /api/navigation/admin` — creates a new navigation item. Body: `{ label, url, linkType?, visibility?, sortOrder?, parentId? }`. Defaults: `linkType = "internal"`, `visibility = "public"`, `sortOrder = 0`, `isActive = true`. Returns `{ item: NavigationItemDetail }` with HTTP 201.
- `PATCH /api/navigation/admin/:id` — updates a navigation item. All fields optional. Returns `{ item: NavigationItemDetail }`.
- `DELETE /api/navigation/admin/:id` — deletes a navigation item. Child items are removed via database CASCADE. Returns `{ deleted: true }`.

All admin routes return `401` when no session is present and `403` when the session's global role is not `admin`. Authorization is enforced by `NavigationService.assertAdminManagementAccess(session.user.globalRole)` called at the top of every admin handler.

#### Authorization Model

`NavigationService.assertAdminManagementAccess(actorGlobalRole: string)` is the single authorization gate for all navigation management operations. It delegates to `AuthorizationService.hasGlobalRole(actorGlobalRole, "admin")` and throws `ForbiddenException` for any role below admin. All admin `NavigationController` handlers call this method before performing any data operation.

#### 1-Level Nesting Constraint

Navigation supports exactly one level of nesting. A child item's `parentId` must point to a top-level item (one whose own `parentId` is `null`). Attempting to set a grandparent relationship (nesting a child under another child) is rejected with `400 Bad Request`. Additionally, a top-level item that already has children cannot be reclassified as a child item without first reassigning or deleting its children; this too is rejected with `400 Bad Request`.

#### `navigation_items` Table Schema

Migration `1748736000001-navigation-items.ts` adds the `navigation_items` table:

| Column | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | `char(36)` | UUID primary key |
| `parent_id` | `char(36)` | Nullable FK to `navigation_items.id` with `ON DELETE CASCADE` |
| `label` | `varchar(128)` | Display label; required, max 128 characters |
| `link_type` | `varchar(16)` | `"internal"` or `"external"`; default `"internal"` |
| `url` | `varchar(512)` | Destination URL; required, max 512 characters |
| `visibility` | `varchar(32)` | `"public"` or `"authenticated"`; default `"public"` |
| `sort_order` | `smallint unsigned` | Ascending display order; default `0` |
| `is_active` | `tinyint(1)` | `1 = active`, `0 = inactive`; default `1` |
| `created_at` | `datetime(3)` | Set at insert |
| `updated_at` | `datetime(3)` | Auto-updated on change |

A composite index `idx_navigation_items_parent_sort` on `(parent_id, sort_order)` supports the ordered tree queries. The self-referential FK enforces cascade deletion of children when a parent is deleted.

#### Response Shape

`NavigationItemDetail`:

```
{
  id: string,
  parentId: string | null,
  label: string,
  linkType: "internal" | "external",
  url: string,
  visibility: "public" | "authenticated",
  sortOrder: number,
  isActive: boolean,
  children: NavigationItemDetail[],
  createdAt: string,   // ISO 8601
  updatedAt: string    // ISO 8601
}
```

Top-level items always include a `children` array (empty when no children exist). Child items are included in the parent's `children` field; they are not returned as separate top-level entries.

#### Web Routes — Admin Navigation Management

`/admin/navigation` — admin navigation management page (`apps/web/app/admin/navigation/page.tsx`). Requires an active session with the global `admin` role. Redirects unauthenticated users to `/login?next=/admin/navigation`. Non-admin sessions see an "Admin access required" error.

Features available from the admin navigation page:
- **Create** — form with Label, URL, Link Type (`internal`/`external`), Visibility (`public`/`authenticated only`), Sort Order, and optional Parent selector (limited to top-level items). Submits `POST /api/navigation/admin`.
- **Toggle visibility** — "Show"/"Hide" buttons toggle `isActive` per item via `PATCH /api/navigation/admin/:id`. Applies to both top-level and child items.
- **Reorder** — up/down arrow buttons swap `sortOrder` values between adjacent siblings within the same level, via two concurrent `PATCH` calls.
- **Delete** — confirms with a browser dialog before calling `DELETE /api/navigation/admin/:id`. Cascade removes children automatically.

#### Dynamic Navigation Shell

`apps/web/components/navigation.tsx` renders the public shell navigation bar dynamically. On each route change it fetches navigation items from the API based on the current session state:

- Guest sessions call `GET /api/navigation/items/public`.
- Authenticated sessions call `GET /api/navigation/items/authenticated`.

A fetch error falls back silently to an empty dynamic items list so the shell still renders. After dynamic items, the shell always appends the fixed auth-state links (Sign in / Register for guests; App / Profile / Settings for authenticated users).

`apps/web/app/navigation/navigation-client.ts` is the typed API client for navigation calls. It exports `adminListNavItems`, `adminCreateNavItem`, `adminUpdateNavItem`, and `adminDeleteNavItem` (all admin, `credentials: "include"`) as well as the `NavigationItemDetail`, `CreateNavigationItemInput`, and `UpdateNavigationItemInput` TypeScript interfaces.

## Runtime Contract Overview

Milestone 1 local development is hybrid by default:

- `web` runs on the host at `localhost:3000`
- `api` runs on the host at `localhost:3001`
- `mysql` runs through `cicd/docker/compose.dev.yml`

The same local Compose file also supports full-stack container validation with the `fullstack` profile, while `cicd/docker/compose.prod.yml` is the single production Compose definition for long-lived `web` and `api` services. Production routing stays behind the existing reverse-proxy integration, so production-oriented Compose does not bind host ports for either app service.
The production `migrate` service is independently runnable as a one-off pre-rollout step and does not depend on starting `api`.

## Environment Ownership

Copy the example env files before running local Compose validation:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
cp apps/web/.env.example apps/web/.env
cp apps/api/.env.example apps/api/.env
```

Ownership is split by runtime boundary:

- `.env.example` - platform/deployment-owned values used by Compose metadata and local MySQL scaffolding
- `apps/web/.env.example` - web-owned values, including `/api` path targeting and container-internal API routing
- `apps/api/.env.example` - API-owned values, including the database contract, auth foundation inputs for password peppering, session-token hashing, verification/session lifetimes, TOTP issuer naming, and recovery-code generation, and Milestone 3 media upload constraints (`MEDIA_UPLOAD_MAX_SIZE_BYTES`, `MEDIA_ALLOWED_MIME_TYPES`, `MEDIA_STORAGE_PATH`) used by the API container and explicit migration flow

The API environment contract now validates these auth settings at startup:

- `AUTH_PASSWORD_PEPPER` is required and must be at least 16 characters.
- `AUTH_SESSION_TOKEN_PEPPER` is required, must be at least 16 characters, and is used when hashing persisted session and email-verification tokens.
- `AUTH_SESSION_TTL_MINUTES` must be an integer from 5 to 43200.
- `AUTH_SESSION_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MINUTES` must be an integer from 5 to 10080 and cannot exceed `AUTH_SESSION_TTL_MINUTES`.
- `AUTH_EMAIL_VERIFICATION_TTL_MINUTES` must be an integer from 5 to 10080 and controls how long a newly issued verification token remains usable.
- `AUTH_EXTERNAL_STATE_TTL_MINUTES` must be an integer from 5 to 60 and controls OAuth callback-state expiry.
- `AUTH_TOTP_ISSUER` is required and names the issuer presented by TOTP authenticators.
- `AUTH_RECOVERY_CODE_COUNT` must be an integer from 6 to 20.
- `AUTH_RECOVERY_CODE_LENGTH` must be an integer from 8 to 16.
- `AUTH_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `AUTH_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`, and `AUTH_GOOGLE_CALLBACK_URL` are required for Google sign-in.
- `AUTH_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID`, `AUTH_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`, and `AUTH_GITHUB_CALLBACK_URL` are required for GitHub sign-in.
- `MEDIA_UPLOAD_MAX_SIZE_BYTES` must be an integer from 1024 to 20971520.
- `MEDIA_ALLOWED_MIME_TYPES` must be a comma-separated list of at least one valid `type/subtype` MIME type.
- `MEDIA_STORAGE_PATH` is required and must be a non-empty string.

The example files are templates only. Production secrets and the external production MySQL connection are managed on the host outside the repository checkout.
